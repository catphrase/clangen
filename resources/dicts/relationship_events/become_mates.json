They stargaze all throughout the night, whispering sweet nothings in each others' ears. The next day, c_n is well aware of their mateship, as m_c and r_c sit in the clearing, sharing tongues and purring at each other.",
                "m_c and r_c have been eyeing each other for a while, and c_n knows it. No one, absolutely no one, is surprised when m_c declares their mateship, and the Clan even looks forward to finding them doing romantic, couple-y things in the future.",

They eat, and after finishing the prey m_c finally confesses. r_c twirls {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} tail with m_c's, headbutting {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} neck lightly and confessing that {PRONOUN/r_c/subject} {VERB/r_c/feel/feels} the same way. Together they return to camp, feeling the suspicious gazes of their fellow warriors.",

Flustered and worried, r_c nervously admits {PRONOUN/r_c/poss} reciprocation with a laugh, and m_c forces {PRONOUN/m_c/poss} fur to lie flat, smiling at r_c.",
